1) because its easer to represt binary on hardware neither its on or its off
2) integrated develpoment environment
3) in text editor you can write a code but you will not get the environment that you would get on code editer 
for a begineer it wouldbe very diffcult 
in code editor you will get a lot of feature like your code will be colourised in a way that would be very useful to you
and you can directly complie the code in code editor
4) step 1) install a ide or a code editor
   step 2) write the code
   step 3) complie the code
